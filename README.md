# ControlsHWSamples

This repository is dedicated to showcasing MATLAB code samples of designing, simulating, and analyzing various types of controllers and observers, including state-feedback control, dead-beat observers, LQR control, and more.

These code samples were taken from homework submissions from the linear controls and digital controls classes taken during my graduate studies at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Each code sample features the original document detailing the homework problems, the corresponding code and other necessary files, and a document containing the solutions to the homework problems.
